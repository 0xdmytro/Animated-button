This code creates a simple webpage that showcases an animated button. Here's what each part does:

HTML Structure:

Defines a standard webpage structure with a <button> element having the class animated-button.
CSS Styles:

The body of the page is styled to center the button horizontally and vertically on the screen with a light gray background.
The button (.animated-button) has:
A gradient background transitioning between two shades of pink.
Rounded corners and bold white text.
Smooth transitions for hover effects.
Hovering over the button:
The background gradient shifts slightly.
The button enlarges slightly using a scaling transformation.
A skewed white overlay (::before pseudo-element) moves across the button on hover:
It starts off-screen to the left and transitions across the button, creating a sliding highlight effect.
Responsive Design:

The layout adapts to different screen sizes due to the use of flexbox in the body and the meta viewport tag for scaling.
This design emphasizes modern, interactive visual effects that are smooth and appealing, suitable for modern web design.
